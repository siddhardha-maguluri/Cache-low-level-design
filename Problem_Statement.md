<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<hr>
<p>We have to do low-level design for a Cache System. We have to support 2 operations:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Put:</b> This will allow to put a value against a key in the cache.</li>
 <li><b>Get:</b> This will allow to get the value associated with a given key.</li>
 <li><b>Eviction:</b> Cache should also support removal of keys, when cache is full and if we try to add more keys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Code should be functionally correct.</li>
 <li>Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional.</li>
 <li>Code should be extensible and scalable.</li>
 <li>Code should have good OOP design.</li>
</ul>
